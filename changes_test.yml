  entry_types: determine which of the types in the template apply to this change.
  This maybe be just one or multiple, for instance "New Features" and
  "Bug Fixes" are common. Enter the one or more types verbatim from the
  template list, separated by comma.

  pull_requests: enter one or more pull request numbers that relate to the change,
  separated a comma.

  releases: enter one or more releases where this change should be included.
  Pure bug fixes may be backported to the current stable and LTS releases.
  Enter the applicable release from the milestone list that can be found
  at https://github.com/astropy/astropy/milestones.

  subpackages: enter one or more astropy subpackages that are impacted by this
  change, separated by a comma.  Available subpackages are:
    config, constants, convolution, coordinates, cosmology, io.ascii, io.fits,
    io.misc, io.registry, io.votable, logger, modeling, nddata, samp, stats,
    table, tests, time, timeseries, uncertainty, units, utils, visualization, wcs

  text: Enter description of the update here, maintaining the example indentation
  of two spaces before the text.  Use the past tense, for instance
  "Added a new method ``Table.cstack()`` for column-wise stacking". Enclose
  literals in double-back ticks as shown.

  text: |-
    The version of constants can be specified via ScienceState in a way
    that ``constants`` and ``units`` will be consistent. [#8517]
- entry_types: [New Features]

    Changed ``coordinates.solar_system_ephemeris`` to also accept local files
    as input. The ephemeris can now be selected by either keyword (e.g. 'jpl',
    'de430'), URL or file path. [#8767]

    Added a ``cylindrical`` property to ``SkyCoord`` for shorthand access to a
    ``CylindricalRepresentation`` of the coordinate, as is already available
    for other common representations. [#8857]

  pull_requests: [8902]
  releases: ['4.0']
  subpackages: [table]
  text: |-
    Improved the implementation of ``Table.replace_column()`` to provide
    a speed-up of 5 to 10 times for wide tables.  The method can now accept
    any input which convertible to a column of the correct length, not just
    ``Column`` subclasses.[#8902]

  text: |-
    Improved the implementation of ``Table.add_column()`` to provide a speed-up
    of 2 to 10 (or more) when adding a column to tables, with increasing benefit
    as the number of columns increases.  The method can now accept any input
    which is convertible to a column of the correct length, not just ``Column``
    subclasses. [#8933]

    Fix bug where adding a column consisting of a list of masked arrays was
    dropping the masks. [#9048]

  subpackages: [table]
  text: |-
    ``Quantity`` columns with custom units can now round-trip via FITS tables,
    as long as the custom unit is enabled during reading (otherwise, the unit
    will become an ``UnrecognizedUnit``). [#9015]

  pull_requests: [9237]

  text: |-
    For the default ``IERS_Auto`` table, which combines IERS A and B values, the
    IERS nutation parameters "dX_2000A" and "dY_2000A" are now also taken from
    the actual IERS B file rather than from the B values stored in the IERS A
    file.  Any differences should be negligible for any practical application,
    but this may help exactly reproducing results. [#9237]
